  Automatic test discovery and runner for the tasty framework.

  Prefix your test case names and tasty-discover will discover, collect and run
  them. All popular test libraries are covered. Configure once and then just
  write your tests. Avoid forgetting to add test modules to your Cabal/Hpack
  files. Tasty ingredients are included along with various configuration
  options for different use cases. Please see the `README.md` below for how to
  get started.
